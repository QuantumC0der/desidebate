# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on preparing the Desi Debate AI project for hackathon submission by ensuring all components are production-ready, well-documented, and easily deployable. The goal is to create a polished, professional submission that showcases the project's technical capabilities while being accessible to judges and users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to quickly understand what the project does and how to run it, so that I can evaluate it efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a judge visits the repository THEN they SHALL see a clear, comprehensive README with project overview, features, and quick start instructions
2. WHEN a judge wants to run the project THEN they SHALL be able to do so in under 5 minutes with clear setup instructions
3. WHEN a judge explores the codebase THEN they SHALL find well-organized code with proper documentation
4. IF the project has complex features THEN there SHALL be visual diagrams and examples to explain them

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want my project to run reliably in different environments, so that judges can test it without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is run on a fresh system THEN it SHALL work without manual configuration beyond the documented setup
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and installation guidance
3. WHEN API keys are not configured THEN the system SHALL still demonstrate core functionality with fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully and provide helpful error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a potential user or contributor, I want to see a live demonstration of the project's capabilities, so that I can understand its value and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web interface loads THEN it SHALL provide an intuitive, responsive user experience
2. WHEN a user starts a debate THEN they SHALL see engaging, realistic AI agent interactions
3. WHEN the debate progresses THEN the system SHALL display clear visualizations of agent states and debate progress
4. WHEN the debate concludes THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful analysis and results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a hackathon organizer, I want to verify the project's technical depth and innovation, so that I can assess its merit for awards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be evidence of advanced AI techniques (RAG, GNN, RL)
2. WHEN examining the architecture THEN it SHALL demonstrate good software engineering practices
3. WHEN testing the system THEN it SHALL show measurable performance and intelligent behavior
4. WHEN reading documentation THEN there SHALL be clear explanations of technical innovations and design decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer interested in the project, I want to understand how to extend or contribute to it, so that I can build upon the work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring the project structure THEN it SHALL be logically organized with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN reading the code THEN it SHALL be well-commented and follow consistent coding standards
3. WHEN looking for contribution guidelines THEN there SHALL be clear instructions for development setup and contribution process
4. WHEN examining the API THEN it SHALL be well-documented with examples and clear interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a hackathon submission, I want to highlight the project's unique value proposition and technical achievements, so that it stands out among other submissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presenting the project THEN it SHALL clearly articulate the problem it solves and its innovative approach
2. WHEN demonstrating features THEN it SHALL showcase the integration of multiple AI technologies working together
3. WHEN explaining the system THEN it SHALL highlight performance metrics, technical challenges overcome, and future potential
4. WHEN comparing to alternatives THEN it SHALL clearly differentiate its unique contributions and advantages
