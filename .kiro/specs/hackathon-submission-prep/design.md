# Design Document

## Overview

The hackathon submission preparation involves creating a comprehensive polish and presentation layer for the Desi Debate AI project. The system is already functionally complete with advanced AI components (RAG, GNN, RL) and a working web interface. The design focuses on enhancing presentation, documentation, deployment readiness, and demonstration capabilities to create a compelling hackathon submission.

## Architecture

### Current System Architecture
The project already has a robust multi-layered architecture:
