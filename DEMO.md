## üéØ Demo Scenarios (8 minutes total)

### Scenario 1: AI Ethics Debate (3 minutes)
**Topic**: "Should AI development be regulated by government?"

**What to Watch For**:
- Agent A (Pro-regulation): Uses safety arguments, cites precedents
- Agent B (Anti-regulation): Emphasizes innovation, market solutions  
- Agent C (Neutral): Asks clarifying questions, weighs both sides

**Key Features Demonstrated**:
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent interaction with distinct personalities
- ‚úÖ Real-time stance tracking and belief updates
- ‚úÖ RAG system retrieving relevant arguments
- ‚úÖ Dynamic strategy adaptation

**Expected Outcome**: Agent B typically surrenders after 3-4 rounds due to strong safety arguments

### Scenario 2: Social Media Impact (3 minutes)
**Topic**: "Is social media's impact on society more positive than negative?"

**What to Watch For**:
- Agents cite different studies and statistics
- Strategy changes based on opponent responses
- GNN predictions influencing argument selection
- Persuasion metrics updating in real-time

**Key Features Demonstrated**:
- ‚úÖ GNN social network analysis (67.77% accuracy)
- ‚úÖ RL strategy learning in action
- ‚úÖ Parallel processing of AI modules
- ‚úÖ Sophisticated debate mechanics

**Expected Outcome**: Usually reaches maximum rounds with nuanced final positions

### Scenario 3: Technical Innovation Showcase (2 minutes)
**Topic**: "Should universal basic income be implemented?"

**Focus**: Technical features rather than debate content

**What to Highlight**:
- **Sub-2 second response times** despite complex AI processing
- **Fallback mechanisms** working without API keys
- **Real-time visualizations** of agent states
- **Export functionality** for results analysis

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q**: "How is this different from ChatGPT debates?"
**A**: "We use specialized AI modules - GNN predicts persuasion success, RL learns optimal strategies, RAG provides domain knowledge. It's not just language generation, it's intelligent social simulation."

**Q**: "What's the practical application?"
**A**: "Education, research, and decision-making. Imagine training negotiators, studying social dynamics, or exploring complex policy decisions through AI simulation."

**Q**: "How accurate are the predictions?"
**A**: "Our GNN model achieves 67.77% accuracy on persuasion prediction using the Reddit ChangeMyView dataset - that's competitive with state-of-the-art social prediction models."
